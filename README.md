# It's Ready!

GLIDE is finally ready! Currently; it only works for the Universal Windows Platform. Versions for Linux, Android, and Apple devices, are on the way!

This will be ready for the Windows Store, as free as this source code, once a UI is built for people to more quickly add their courses.

Currently, courses can be added very easily, but the TopicModel, LessonModel, and AnswerModel files need to be edited before compiling, so that the program will have your course. Do not worry, this process is VERY easy to do.

Full instructions are on the way, so that even a person with ZERO programming experience, can build a course into the program, and compile it. 

If you do not know much about behavioral psychology, then wait for the instructions before starting to build your course! The question files, and the lesson files, are not always best to just copy and past from a textbook. They need to be designed a certain way, for best results.

# GLIDE

GLIDE is a program that teaches people, by implementing scientific research on learning. It's name is inspired by the teaching machine that B.F. Skinner invented, which he named "GLIDER." GLIDE is better than GLIDER, because it uses research that did not exist at the time GLIDER was invented. 

Like B.F. Skinner's GLIDER machine; GLIDE implements a Continuous Reinforcement schedule, for all of the material in which GLIDE is teaching to a respondent. Unlike GLIDER, the spacing of repetitions for the content of study sessions, is not able to be adjusted to eventually suit the needs of the respondent. The spacing system that Skinner implemented was very inefficient, even though the results were still much better than those that learning institutions still produce to this day. 

GLIDER still resulted in a Serial-Position effect. It had to. GLIDER also did not ensure, that information for a course would not decline in a respondent's retrieval ability, much lower than 95%, even if GLIDER were to be used to learn new information from, on a daily basis.

GLIDE schedules a repetition, for each individual engram, to be performed when the forgetting curve shows that the chance for the engram's retrieval decays to 95%. This results in a mix of information to perform repetitions on in a study session, and does not usually, if ever, result in a the Serial-Position effect's dip, after the second day of study for a new course. Skinner did not have the spacing calculations that GLIDE implements, which have been available now for a while.

Comparison of GLIDE vs GLIDER:

GLIDER
1. GLIDER was an expensive machine. 
2. It used Continuous Reinforcement, without implementing Punishment which may cause aversion to it's use. 
3. It was difficult to install a course into it. 
4. GLIDER did not base the spacing schedule on a mathematical model.
5. The Serial-Position effect was not avoidable with GLIDER's use.
6. The memory of a learned course would decay once complete. 

GLIDE
1. GLIDE is completely free software. 
2. It uses Continuous Reinforcement, without implementing Punishment which may cause aversion to it's use. 
3. It is simple to install a course onto it. 
4. GLIDER does base the spacing schedule on a mathematical model, which is backed by scientific research to efficiently schedule the spacing of repetitions, per engram.
5. Hypothetically; the Serial-Position effect stops occuring, soon after a new course is started.
6. The memory of a learned course will not decay once a course is complete, but only if GLIDE is still used, which would probably be to learn new courses.



Users can add their college textbooks, into their own GLIDE program. Rules to build a course need to be followed, in order for the course to be learned at maximum efficiency. These rules will be made available when GLIDE is ready to be used. 

I am in no way recommending that courses built from non-free textbooks be shared. I also don't want anyone making courses and selling them with GLIDE, or for GLIDE. But I can not prevent that. But free courses can be built, which are equivalent in knowledge to learn, as any course that costs money which is built.

I DO recommend, and WANT, courses to be built for GLIDE which are equivalent, or greater, in content to a textbook used at a high-end institution, to share with everyone. I would be happy to host these courses from the Dartomic website, to be available for download by anyone that desires the material. But, ONLY IF, the standards have been well followed in the creation of the course that is submitted, and there is no plagiarization. Any submitted courses will be available on Dartomic, pending a review of the material. These would not only be great to save people A LOT of money, but to do a better job at teaching than an institution would be providing any students with.  



Fully detailed instructions of how to build a course will be available soon, after the first version GLIDE is ready. And, of course, instructions on how to build GLIDE from source will be available as well.
